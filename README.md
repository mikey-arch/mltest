# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor

An end-to-end ML pipeline that predicts student math scores using demographic and academic data. It covers the full process from **data ingestion and preprocessing** to **model training and evaluation**, and finally **deployment** through a Flask web app. Multiple algorithms are applied, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, CatBoost, and AdaBoost, making it a robust solution for student performance prediction.
